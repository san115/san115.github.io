      <p><b>What are ennumerables?</b> Enumerables in ruby provide ways of manipulating or searching and sorting to extract information from a collection, such as arrays or hashes. They are modules that are more or less offshoots of the each method. They provide a way of working with a type of looping, iterating, through the collection.</p>

      <p><b>The map method</b> The map method works very similar to the each method by setting up iteration. One added advantage to using map is that you have the option of making alterations to the elements in the array with or without modifying the actual array; it can be used as destructive (map!--creates permanent change) or as nondestructive(map--temporary change for instance only) method. It accepts a block of code and modify each element in the group, then it returns the elements in the modified form. For example:</p> 

      <table>
            <tr>
              <td>array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>array.map { │x│ x * 2 } will result in [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</td>
            </tr>
      </table>
     
    </section>
