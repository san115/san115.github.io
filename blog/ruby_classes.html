      <p><b>What are classes?</b> It's likely that descriptions of Ruby will include a statement that it is an object-oriented program. This concept may not be clear at first, but by learning about what classes are in Ruby, the idea may become clearer. Classes in ruby provides codes needed for the type of a particular object. For example, if an object is an order form, then the class will probably include codes needed to process the information in the order form, such as the order, quantity, price, methods of payment etc. The codes needed to perform a specific function is grouped into a set of codes called a method, and a class includes a set of methods needed to perform the various functions or operations needed for that particular object.
      </p>

      <p>One useful aspect of having methods in a class is that it provides a flexibility to call upon only the specific functions needed for a particular object.    </p>
