      <p><b>What is Ruby on Rails?</b> Rails is a framework for building websits. It uses Ruby with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web applications that run on a web server. It creates software that simplifies having to create complex websites. Rails has conventions that must be followed, so if is considered to be opinionated, since the programmer has less decisions to make. Rails provide defaults, a setting or value automatically assigned, and make assumptions. This “Convention Over Configuration” means a developer spends less time setting up configuration files. Rails also practices the principle of "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) to avoi duplication of code. When code is duplicated, an application becomes more complex, which makes it more difficult to maintain and more vulnerable to bugs. The DRY principle is also applied to development processes. Rails uses Ruby’s metaprogramming features to not reuse and eliminate code whenever possible.</p>

      <p> Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application. Web applications are useful because developers can assemble the HTML file from smaller components, called “partials”. Or if the displaying content is from a database, instead of complex programming code that accesses the database included in the HTML file, separating the database makes it a more maintainable programs. 
      Also, a web application can add features to the website.</p>
