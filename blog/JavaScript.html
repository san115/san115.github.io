      <p><b>How does looping in JavaScript compare to looping in Ruby?</b> Both JavaScript and Ruby offer ways to create loops that executes the same operation on a group of elements. The while and for loops are features in both languages that work similarly.
      </p>

      <p>In Javascript, the for loop can be used to perform an operation for a certain number of times. This can be done by specifying the beginning and end value of the loop  and an increment value that tells how much the beginning value should increase or decrease to reach the end value. Then an operation is specified, which will be performed in the loop. For example, to multiply a group of 10 numbers, each by 5, then the for loop can be used. JavaScript also has a for/in loop, which can be used for properties of an object. In JavaScript an object has properties. For example, an object named toy can have as its properties type, color, size, and any other. And, each properties can have one or more values. The for/in loop can access each property. So, to manipulate all the properties in an object, the for/in loop could be used.</p> 
      <p>The while loop works for as long as a specified condition is true. So, to multiply all the numbers in set by 5, the while loop can be used by setting a condition that while a variable is less than or equal to the quantity of numbers in the set, and then increment the variable so the loop eventually ends.  </p>

      <p>In Ruby, the for and while loops also work similarly but with different syntax. The for loop in Ruby assigns a variable to a range of values, which identify the beginning value and end value for the loop. The for/in loop in Ruby also works the same way as the each method, and also similar to the for/in loop in JavaScript. The while loop in Ruby also can be used for as long as the set condition is true.</p>
