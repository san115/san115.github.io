	  		<li><h4>Figuring Out the Content</h4> <p></p> In my experience, it has always been a daunting task to figure out the content. It took me a while to figure out that one of the biggest cause for this difficulty has been due to the fact that the purpose and goal of having a website has not been properly defined. And, part of that comes from figuring out the type of information to share and to what degree. I've still not been able to figure out where to set these boundaries. One factor is the the boundaries shift from subject to subject, usually based on my comfort level with them and/or from figuring out how much I want to share, which can vary from day to day.
        <p>Another factor has to do with figuring out whether the content is worth the time and effort required to post. Often, it seems as if there isn't anything worthy enough to justify the time and effort. And, there are many others who have relayed the information and often have done so in a much better way. Although this is not a competition, nor does it necessarily require comparisons. However, it doesn't seem necessary to add to the already daunting amount of blogs with redundant materials.</p>
        </li>
	  		<li><h4>Making Decisions</h4> <p>For the reasons cited, making decisions on what to include or not is still an aspect that I struggle with. As with other tasks, indecision seems to come when I'm approaching the process in a large scale. Instead of concentrating on each taks at a time, I often find myself worrying about the completed project, before anything has been assembled. This often leads to blurring of the purpose of the post, as well puts unnecessary pressure on the decision making itself. </p> </li>
