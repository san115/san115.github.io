<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair? Unfortunately, there was a bit of confusion, and we had trouble connecting with each other. In the end, we made contact through email, but did not get a chance to have a real interaction.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process? It was helpful as it made me think about the type of content that will appears on the page and how it will be organized, as well how it'll look and how the visitors will navigate around the page and the site.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? We did not get a good opportunity to discuss this, but for me a good wireframe is one that makes it clear what the topic is about, and easy-to-use navigation and technical features.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? In terms of html5, there are some new semantics to organize the contents of a page:
article: text and content about a topic
section: content that are related thematically to the main topic of the site
aside: suppplemnary topics that are related to the main topic
nav: a collection of links
