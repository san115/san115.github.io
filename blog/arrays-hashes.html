      <p><b>What are arrys?</b> Arrays are collections of ordered data. They can be composed of text or numbers or both. The specific element of an array is identified by an index that being with zero for the first element of an arrary. For example, in an array of alphabetical letters, first letter "a" is assigned the index of "0", whereas the last letter ("z") is assigned "23". Arrays can be useful in storing and manipulating data, since they can be used and manipulated in endless ways, such as as addiing, removing, or replacing elements, creating new arrays, adding and stubtacting arrays. Arrys are also useful when setting up loops that rquuire same operation for a group of elements.</p>

      <p><b>What are hashes?</b>b> Hashes are similar to arrays but they have an added dimension in that the group of data is defined by keys and associated values. For example, a hash for types of foods might have fruit as a key. Then the corresponding values of the key might be types of fruit, so the values apple and orange will each have an associated key of fruit. Hashes can also be manipulated in such as as addiing, removing, or replacing elements, creating new hashes. Hashes are a good way to organize data with a necessary association that can be easily be recalled.</p>
