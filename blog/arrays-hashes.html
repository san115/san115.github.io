      <p><b>What are arrys?</b> Arrays are collections of data that can be composed of text or numbers or both. The specific element of an array is identified by using an index that being with zero for the first element of an arrary. For example, in an array of alphabetical letters, the first letter ("a") is assigned the index of "0", whereas the last letter ("z") is assigned "23". The specific elements of a array can be used and manipulated in endless ways, including in calulations, or printing text. As well, the array themselvels can be manipulated in such as as addiing, removing, or replacing elements, creating new arrays, adding and stubtacting arrays. Arrys are useful when setting up loops that rquuire same operation for a group of elements.</p>

      <p><b>What are hashes?</b>b> Hashes are similar to arrays but they have an added dimension in that the group of data is categorized into groups. The elements of hashes are defined by keys and the corresponding value. For example, a hash for types of foods might have as keys fruit, vegetable, meat. Then the corresponding values of the key might be apple, carrot, fish. respectively. Hashes can also be manipulated in such as as addiing, removing, or replacing elements, creating new hashes. Hashes are a good way to organize data with necessary association that can be easily be recaled.</p>
