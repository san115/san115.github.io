      Based on the first week, DBC seems to provide a learning environment that seems more progressive than the traditional version. While the students are expected to meet certain level of standards, oneâ€™s progress seems to be largely left to self-determination.  Students can get as much out of the experience as they each see fit, but the effort has to be initiated by them. The instructions provide the basics, but at the same time DBC also seems to expect students to explore on their own. Learning by doing seems to be a key ingredient.

        One unexpected aspect of DBC is the amount of collaboration thats encouraged in the program, the chefs in a kitchen scenario, with everyone working together and contributing to the creations. While it is an idea I'm curious to explore, it makes me wonder what I could contribute, or even whether I could, since my past experience consisted of doing work mainly on my own.
