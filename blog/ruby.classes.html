      <p><b>What are classes?</b> It's likely that descriptions of Ruby will include a statement that it is an object-oriented program. This concept may not be clear at first, but by learning about what classes are in Ruby, the idea may become clearer. Classes in ruby provides codes needed for the type of a particular type of object. For example, if an object is an order form, then the class will probably include codes needed to process the information in the order form, such as the order, quantity, price, methods of payment etc. The codes needed to perform a specific function is grouped into a set of codes called a method, and a class includes a set of methods needed to perform the various functions or operations needed for that particular object.
      </p>

      <p>One useful aspect of having methods in a class is that the methods are called as needed. This provides a flexibility and efficiency as only the specific functions needed for a particular object and its conditions are performed, whick does away with unnecessary work of redundency. This makes sense as any type of object, on its own requires specific sets of functions, based on its particular condition. So even an order form as an object will require specific sets of functions to process it, such as whether the order is regular or express. So in this sense, Ruby provides codes that can be tailored for not only the general befavior and needs of the tpe of object but also applies tne necessary functions for the specific need of each object. </p>
