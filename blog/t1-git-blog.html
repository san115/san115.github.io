      What are the enefits of version control? Version control allows developers to make changes without risking harm or damage to the master, or the ideal, version. By working on copies of a master version, developers are also freed from having to recreate the whole work, and instead can develop sections of the work.  It’s a good way to test out and experiment different methods without risking the integrity of the master or introducing errors. It also allows for multiple developers to work on a project at the same time.

        How does git help you keep track of changes? Git is a program that helps developers to keep track of changes, which is a key feature of version control. Developers create branches, or copies, of the master, which they use to make changes. By using copies, changes can be compared to the original and they are recorded in a log, which show the history of how a project has changed and evolved.

        Why use GitHub to store your code? GitHub is a repository for open source codes, which means that developers’ share their codes with other developers and the public. Having codes be open source is a way to not only share coding, but also allows for the codes to evolve and develop as other use and change the codes for their purposes. And, because credit is given to the developer who writes the original code and also to those who contribute to its development, it maintains copyright conventions.
