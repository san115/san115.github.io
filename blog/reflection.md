**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
I learned the difference between them: padding is the space between the content and the border, for example, the position of the text in a box can be determined by using padding; border shows the boundary of the object that contains content, for example a table has borders, including columns, rows, and cells and blocks of text or images have borders, with size determined by width and height; margin is the space between the elements or borders of the web page, so it can be used to determine position of text boxes, tables, pictures, etc.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
I learned that it'll require a good amount of practice to beable to use them effectively. While it seems easy to move elements around in a general way--which section of the web page it appears, in which order, size, but much more difficult to use them with precision. This also seems to be complicated when one has to consider the different set ups in which the Web pages will appear--the size of th screen on the device (laptop, tablet, smartphone), the types of browsers, and so on.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**I don't have a lot of design elemets, as the content of page follows a basic layout. It found the basic setting--the styles that might appear in the default file, such as background color, setting margins for web page, font style and color. I found having to implement the finer details more difficult. Also, assign objects to class seems like a very useful way to assign both general and specific styles, however I've run into problems when attempting to use class identifiers, so most likely will need more practice.


**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
I learned that there is no end to styling, one can get caught by attempting to style every element. as it is possible to do that. So, it probably would be a good idea to figure out which elements can share same styles and which elemnts will have degrees of specific styling.
