	  		<li><h4>Professional Experience</h4><p>I've spent much of the last twenty years working in publishing, primarily in educational materials. During this time, I worked as a content editor, which included creating instructional plans and outlines, prototypes, writing guidelines, in addition to editing manuscripts and proofs.

        </p> </li>
	  		<li><h4>Interests</h4> <p></p> My interests vary from time to time, probably as a result of acquiring new and varied experiences. Recently, I bacame a fan of hockey, the NY Rangers to be specific. And, I've renewed my interest in music and have made timid attempts at learning to play the guitar.
